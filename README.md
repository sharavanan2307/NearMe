RTO office or the Regional Transport Office is a government body specifically established to oversee all transport-related operations in the country. RTOs are located throughout the country in each state and union territory. RTOs are responsible for enforcing the rules as laid down by the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988.
The department also maintains a database of all the vehicles operating in the country as well as issues licenses for drivers. Besides, the RTO office also collects road taxes, supervises pollution checks, and ensures the enforcement of all road transportation rules. If you own or drive a vehicle in India, you will need to visit the RTO to get your vehicle registered, obtain a driver’s license or renew your driver’s license, etc.
RTOs are also responsible for improving road and vehicle safety, especially to avoid accidents and other road fatalities.
